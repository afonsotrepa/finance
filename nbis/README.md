Results before 2Q2024 are irrelevant as they pertain to Russian assets that have been sold off.

This company's feasibility depends on their ability to sell compute power for more than it costs.
Currently, they have about a 50% gross profit, but once the depreciation of the servers is taken into account, operating profits turn negative.

They seem to be essentially subsidizing the server costs for their clients, it's unclear how they'll turn ever profit.

## Fully owned subsidiaries
### Avride
Avride is a self-driving startup initially based in Russia and now with operations mainly in the UAE and Israel.

Likely way behind competitors in what's going to be a winner takes all business.

### Toloka
Data labelling company, like Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth but tiny.
Saturated market, no clear moat.
