# Equity report on Wetouch Technology (WETH)
Wetouch Technology is trading at 20% of book value (vast majority of which is cash right now) and a PE of 4x.

Is this deep fucking value or a value trap?

## Introduction
Wetouch  Technology Inc. ("Wetouch") is a NASDAQ listed (ticker WETH) involved in the development, manufacturing, sales and servicing of medium to large projected capacitive touchscreens.
The company is fully located in Chengdu, China with foreign holding companies to facilitate listing in a US stock exchange. Domestic sales make up about 69% of revenue.

## Corporate Structure
Due to recent liberalisation in the foreign ownership of companies incorporated in the People's Republic of China ("PRC"), Wetouch does not feature the troubled variable interest entity ("VIE") which was common in the past.
Instead, the PRC company (Sichaun Vtouch Technologies) is fully owned by the Hong Kong subsidiary.

## Unusual risk factors
The current market cap of the company is less than $20 million, despite it holding over $100 million in cash and less than $5 million in liabilities.

I believe this discrepancy is partly due to the fact their previous auditor (BF Borgers CPA PC) is being sued by the SEC for fraud and their current auditor (Enrome LLP, starting May 10th, 2024) has not yet been able to fully audit their books.

They've also repeatedly filed their quarterly and annual SEC reports late and have had similar issues with late filings in China.
Wetouch has been sued several times for failure to pay suppliers and debtors, including a case where they defaulted on a $8.5 million loan, leading to $1.7 million in penalties.

On June 3rd, 2024 three members of the board resigned with no reason given.
They have since been replaced.

The July 8th, 2024 appointment of Ms.Xing Tang as CFO should rectify some of these issues, particularly when it comes to SEC fillings due to hist past experience.
She has previous experience with 2 US listed companies (Elong Power Holdings Limited and China XD Plastics Co., Ltd).
The stock price of both of these companies has crashed for unclear reasons in the past few years.


## Business operations
Revenue comes from manufacturing and selling touchscreens in several locations in mainland China.

Six customers made up more than 10% of revenue in 2023:
1. Siemens Industrial Automation products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. -- 22.5%
2. Shangai Sigang Electronics Co., Ltd -- 16.5%
3. E-Lead Electronic Co. Ltd. -- 15.7%
4. MultimediaLink Inc. -- 14.1%
5. Suzhou Weinview Co., Ltd -- 11.3%

Total of top 5 customers: 80.1%


## Locations
Their main location was subject to government directed relocation in 2021, leading to a $16.4 million compensation and an agreement to lease another facility for $57 thousand a month.

They've committed capital to a new facility  in Chengdu Medicine City (Technology Park) and expected completion of the building by first quarter of 2025 and start of production there by the third quarter of 2025.
